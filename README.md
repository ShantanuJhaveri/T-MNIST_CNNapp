# Learning Project: Number Detector ðŸ”¢
This repository is for the educational script that I developed for a number detector. It uses the MNIST dataset and trains a CNN using `keras/tensorflow` <br>
The model also has an app.py, so that students can see that their script is actually running in real time. They can draw a number using the `OpenCV` canvas, and then submit it to the model for a prediction. The model has a 98 percent accuracy, and students can manipulate the script by changing the epochs, the slide, the number of layers and sizes of the layers
